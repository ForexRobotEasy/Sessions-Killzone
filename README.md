## Usage

The code defines the session start and end times for the London and New York sessions. It then calculates the killzones for each session by adding and subtracting 30 minutes from the session start and end times. The volatility of these killzones is determined by retrieving historical price data within the given time range and applying a suitable algorithm to calculate the volatility.

The code also includes functions to retrieve historical price data and calculate volatility using a suitable algorithm. These functions can be customized or replaced with the specific implementation required by the trading platform.

The main entry point of the program is the `OnStart()` function, where it prints the London Session Killzone, New York Session Killzone, and Volatile Trading Periods. The start and end times of the killzones, as well as the calculated volatility values for each session, are displayed.
